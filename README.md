# Exploring Gender Imbalances across Germany

This is a random hobby project in which I wanted to use R to visualize data on gender imbalances in Landkreisen across Germany, with a goal of seeing where in Germany the differences are the most extreme, particularly when looking at the 18-35 age range. 

The full analysis can be seen here: https://tori-d.github.io/genderimbalances/

The file structure is as such: 

**data**

In this folder, you have the raw + cleaned data sources used for the analysis. The raw data comes from Destatis, the federal statistics portal for Germany. 

**docs**

This folder contains the HTML page that the above-mentioned URL is based off of.

**r-files**

This file contains an R file with the fortified shapefile to make compiling the Markdown document more efficient

**shapefiles**

This file contains shapefiles for Germany's Landkreise. The shapefiles were downloaded from the Bundesamt für Kartographie und Geodäsie.
